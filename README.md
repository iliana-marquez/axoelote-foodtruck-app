# Axoelote Food Truck Webapp

**The Problem:** Food trucks face a daily challenge - customers arrive at yesterday's location to find an empty parking spot. Meanwhile, owners juggle phone calls for private event bookings while trying to update social media with today's location.

**The Solution:** A web application for food truck business management that automates location updates and streamlines event bookings. Customers check one reliable source for current truck location and hours. Owners manage everything through a simple admin interface that prevents double-booking disasters.

**The Result:**
Axoelote Food Truck Webapp Live
<!-- Westite on different devices image placeholder -->

**How it works:**
- Owner updates today's location once â†’ appears instantly on customer-facing site
- Customer submits private event request â†’ system checks availability automatically
- Owner approves booking â†’ event appears on public calendar, blocking that date
- Regular customers see "Private event today - truck unavailable" instead of wasting a trip

**Core functionality includes:**
- Real-time location and schedule updates
- Booking request system with automatic conflict prevention
- Customer accounts for tracking event requests
- Mobile-responsive design for on-the-go access
- Admin dashboard for daily business management

**Technical highlights:** User authentication, CRUD operations, automated workflows, responsive design, and cloud deployment.

## Database Structure
<!-- DB ERD Placeholder -->
This ERD architecture addresses the operational complexities of running a mobile food service with dual revenue streams: regular street service & private catering events.

**Business Problem Resolution**
1. **Dynamic Location Management:**
The separation between REGULAR_SCHEDULE and EVENT models solves the fundamental food truck challenge of unpredictable locations. Customers need reliable information about where to find the truck, while the owner requires flexibility to override regular patterns for higher-profit catering opportunities. The datetime fields support multi-day closures for vacation periods without disrupting the booking system.
2. **Revenue Optimization Through Booking Management:**
The BOOKING_REQUEST to EVENT workflow automates the owner's most profitable activities. The 70-guest minimum in validation rules reflects real economics - food trucks achieve better margins through private catering than street sales. The automatic event creation prevents double-booking while ensuring approved events appear on the public schedule immediately.
3. **Customer Communication & Trust:**
The conditional display logic (private vs open events) maintains customer trust by providing transparent availability information without compromising private client confidentiality. Customers see accurate schedule information while private event details remain protected.
4. **Data Integrity for Business Operations:**
The intentional redundancy between BOOKING_REQUEST and EVENT serves audit and customer service functions. When disputes arise or customers need booking confirmations, the original request data remains intact even if event details are modified for operational reasons.
5. **Growth Support Infrastructure:** *(future implementation)*
Models like TESTIMONIAL and SOCIAL_MEDIA_POST support marketing efforts essential for food truck visibility. The CONTACT_INQUIRY system handles general business questions that don't require bookings, reducing administrative overhead.

**Technical Decisions Supporting Business Needs**
1. **Automatic Event Creation:**
Eliminates manual data entry errors that could result in customer disappointment or lost revenue from scheduling conflicts.
2. **Date Uniqueness Constraints:**
Prevents overbooking scenarios that would damage business reputation and create operational chaos.
3. **User Authentication Requirements:**
Ensures booking accountability while building a customer database for future marketing efforts.

The structure balances operational efficiency with customer experience, supporting both immediate business needs and future growth scenarios typical of successful food service ventures.
